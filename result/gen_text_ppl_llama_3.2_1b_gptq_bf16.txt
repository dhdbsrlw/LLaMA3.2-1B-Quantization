But, there was another brave boy named Bob, who could find the red ball. One day, Bob saw a light in the dark pit. He wondered what was going on. He looked at his watch. It was very late. Bob was getting hungry. He said, "I wonder if I have any supper in my magic bag." Then he remembered he had the magic bag. He put his hand in his bag and felt around. Finally, he found the red ball! He ran to the pit. It was so dark that the light from the magic bag helped him find the ball. He grabbed the ball and started running away, but he could not get out of the pit. The red ball and the magic bag were gone. He turned back to look at the pit. Now there was a hole. He dropped his magic bag into the hole and ran away. He never thought he would drop his bag in the hole and leave the pit. He ran as fast as he could. He wanted to find a way out of the pit. Maybe he could use his magic to get out. Bob ran as fast as he could, but still the hole was getting bigger. He was so upset that he dropped the magic bag. He ran away and never thought he would drop the bag in the hole and leave the pit.
