Soon the sun started to rise, and Sam and Tom looked so sad and sad.\nWhen they looked up, they could see the sun. Tom and Sam raised their hands and prayed. A big voice came from the sky and said, "I will help you." Tom and Sam put out their hands, and the sky opened. They could see the sun shining brightly. The sky closed and closed.\nOne day, the sky opened again and Tom and Sam saw the sun shining again. They looked in the sky and saw the sky open again. They put their hands out and saw the sun. They prayed in the sky and said, "Thank you for helping us." Then they closed their hands to keep them open. That was the last they saw of the sky. That was the end of their story.\nThe moral of the story is that you should be careful where you put your hands. You never know when the sky will open for help. When it does, you need to put your hands out to be saved.\nThis story was written by Mary Oliver."<|end_of_text|>

Tom and Sam were stuck in the pit. They called for help, but no one could hear them. They were sad and scared, and they never got out of the pit. \n\nThe next day, Tom decided to play in a different part of the park. He thought about how to get his red ball. He thought about what he could do, and then he knew what to do. He took a brick and put it at the bottom of the pit. He put a rope on the brick to pull him out.\n\nTom and his friend, Sam, climbed down into the pit, which was filled with water. \n\nTom found his ball and the two friends went home in peace.
The brick and rope are really useful when we are lost and cannot see. If you know what to do, you can find your lost friend easily.
I have two friends, Tom and Sam. Tom and I play in a different place each day.
The brick is a tool we use when we are stuck. We take a brick to the pit, fill it with water, and use a rope to pull ourselves out.
I was playing in the park with my friends Tom and Sam, and I had lost my ball. I was very sad because I couldn't find my ball. I was so lost that I could not find my ball. I was afraid that I would never find my ball again.
I knew what I could do, I could build a tool called a brick, fill it with water, and use it to pull myself out of the pit. I helped Tom and Sam build a brick to save us, and then we all got out of the pit.
The ball was now in the park, and we all played together happily ever after.
I have learned that when I am lost, I can use a brick to get out of the pit and find my friends.
I can remember that if I use a brick and rope, I can climb out of the pit and find my ball.
I can remember that if I ask a kind friend, Tom or Sam, to help me, and if we work together, we can find our lost friends.<|end_of_text|>
